<h1>What is SOAR?
</h1>  
        <h4>Security, Orchestration, Automation, Response</h4>  
<br>A solution to improve security operations through the automation and harmonic orchestration of tools that deal with threat intelligence management, security event management, and SecOps processes. The SOAR project aims to create a centralized system to more easily access, manage, and remediate security incidents in lab endpoints, effectively decreasing incident response times while increasing the efficiency of the security/devOps process.
